# Module6diagnaviagation
This week the asignment came in three parts. The first part, we were asked to generate two matrices using the given data strings and then perform basic addition and subtraction using them; I did so, saving the results as MatriceAB (addition) and MatriceBA (subtraction), generating two new matrices. For the second half we were given a data string of four numbers to be the diagonal of a new matrix, which we must create only using the diag(x) function and which must have a size of 4. I spent some time toying around with the diag(x) function to figure out how it worked, and ultimately felt that, while I had concerns, I had produced a matrix with 4-1-2-3 in its diagonal and which was 4x4, and therefore seemed to satisfy the ansignment. In the third asignment we were given a matrix 5x5 with the spaces filled by a diagonal of 3 and various instances of the numbers 1,2,and 0. We were told to recreate this matrix using only the diag(x) function. Unfortunately, while I tried a number of factors such as altering nrow and rcol, using a data.frame to hold the values, and other tricks I am left unable to reproduce the given matrix as listed, only able to create a matrix of the same length and width with the same numbers used and the same diagonal rather than what the professor actually wants. I understand that I will recieve a 0 on this assignment, and perhaps the course as a whole.
